Raspberry Pi Tracking Device: developed to monitor exhibit attendance at the Yale Peabody Musuem

Created by Annie Chen, Torie Nielsen, Deniz Saip and David Schwartz

# Quick Overview

Benjamin is a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B with Wide Angled Camera, programmed to take pictures at 1 second intervals, analyze those pictures to determine the number of people and duration of time they spent at the exhibit, write that data to text files, and email them daily.

For detailed information on how to build your own Benjamin, check out the guide: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_sRt5c3WoLKZHp4RUdBak1CdU0

Note: this guide includes information on how to set up the Raspberry Pi, import the code, and create a case (with a file for 3D printing, which is how we built ours). 

#To Do

-rewrite the relevant parts of the guide to use github instead of zip files
-comment and rename files to be more readable
